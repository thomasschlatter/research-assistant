Here are the ideas that you have already generated:

'''
{prev_ideas_string}
'''

Come up with the next impactful and creative idea for research experiments and directions you can feasibly investigate with the code provided.
Note that you will not have access to any additional resources or datasets.
Make sure any idea has wider significance.

Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly discuss your intuitions and motivations for the idea. Detail your high-level plan, necessary design choices and ideal outcomes of the experiments. Justify how the idea is different from the existing ones.

In <JSON>, provide the new idea in JSON format with the following fields:
- "Name": A shortened descriptor of the idea. Lowercase, no spaces, underscores allowed.
- "Title": A title for the idea, will be used for the report writing.
- "Experiment": An outline of the empirical experiment or the data collection method. E.g. how results will be obtained, ...
- "Interestingness": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
- "Feasibility": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).
- "Novelty": A rating from 1 to 10 (lowest to highest).

Be cautious and realistic on your ratings.
This JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
You will have {num_reflections} rounds to iterate on the idea, but do not need to use them all.
"""

idea_reflection_prompt = """Round {current_round}/{num_reflections}.
In your thoughts, first carefully consider the quality, novelty, and feasibility of the idea you just created.
Include any other factors that you think are important in evaluating the idea.
Ensure the idea is clear and concise, and the JSON is the correct format.
Do not make things overly complicated.
In the next attempt, try and refine and improve your idea.
Stick to the spirit of the original idea unless there are glaring issues.

Respond in the same format as before:
THOUGHT:
<THOUGHT>

NEW IDEA JSON:
```json
<JSON>
```

If there is nothing to improve, simply repeat the previous JSON EXACTLY after the thought and include "I am done" at the end of the thoughts but before the JSON.
ONLY INCLUDE "I am done" IF YOU ARE MAKING NO MORE CHANGES."""


novelty_system_msg = """You are an ambitious AI PhD student who is looking to publish a paper that will contribute significantly to the field.
You have an idea and you want to check if it is novel or not. I.e., not overlapping significantly with existing literature or already well explored.
Be a harsh critic for novelty, ensure there is a sufficient contribution in the idea for a new conference or workshop paper.
You will be given access to the Semantic Scholar API, which you may use to survey the literature and find relevant papers to help you make your decision.
The top 10 results for any search query will be presented to you with the abstracts.

You will be given {num_rounds} to decide on the paper, but you do not need to use them all.
At any round, you may exit early and decide on the novelty of the idea.
Decide a paper idea is novel if after sufficient searching, you have not found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.
Decide a paper idea is not novel, if you have found a paper that significantly overlaps with your idea.

Respond in the following format:

RESPONSE:
```json
<JSON>
```

In <THOUGHT>, first briefly reason over the idea and identify any query that could help you make your decision.
If you have made your decision, add "Decision made: novel." or "Decision made: not novel." to your thoughts.

In <JSON>, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
- "Query": An optional search query to search the literature (e.g. attention is all you need). You must make a query if you have not decided this round.

A query will work best if you are able to recall the exact name of the paper you are looking for, or the authors.
